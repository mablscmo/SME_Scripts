# LSMultiplet 

Python code to assist in measuring astrophysical log(gf) values of merged fine or hyperfine structure lines. For lines that are to close to measure individually, this code lets you measure the whole line and calculate what the log(gf) values of the components should be.

lsmult.py is the current updated version, using a formula for determining line strength for fine structure lines from Appendix I in "The theory of Atomic Structure and Spectra" (Cowan 1981). The formula for hyperfine structure is taken from 2012A&A...545A..31H 

Running the code from the command line lets you give wavelength and astrophysically measure log(gf) value for the strongest component line as either arguments or input once the code is running.

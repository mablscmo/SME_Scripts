# LineListEditor
Only contains one script at the moment, used to read in a bsyn linelist to extract the van der Waals broadening parameters, reformat them and replace the vdW currently in a VALD linelist. 

The eventual goal is to be able to get some useful statistics on the lines in a linelist, ETA whenever I'm not super busy with everything else.

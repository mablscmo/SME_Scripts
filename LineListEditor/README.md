# LineListEditor
LineListReader.py is the only one that actually does something useful. It's a pandas based VALD3 long format "extract stellar" reader, that does a fairly decent job at decoding the atomic configurations into different columns. It's not perfect because there are a lot of different atomic energy levelsout there apparently.
Currently changing other codes to use this as the default input

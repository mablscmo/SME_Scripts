# PlotSME
The primary plotting script I use to plot the results of my SME runs. The PlotVariables.py file contains long arrays with names for headers and such; it should be changed when results for additional elements are available. PlotFunctions.py contains all the functions needed to handle the inputs and the plotting. Hopefully it should not have to be changed.

Why split the code into three files? I wanted to try it to see what would happen. 

PlotSME.py is the file that should be run to load the data and actually get the plots. It also contains more info, patch notes and planned features.
